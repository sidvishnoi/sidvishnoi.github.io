# Socket Chat

> [sidvishnoi/socket-chat][1]

A Chat Application using Unix network sockets featuring user authentication, multiple chatrooms and private messaging & terminal based user interface (inspired by IRC).

Implmented in both Python (in 2017) and C++ (2018) as a part of extended class projects. The C++ version was done along with my project partner - Shikha Chauhan.

**Features:** (inspired by IRC)

-   user authentication - register, login
-   makes uses of a persistent object-based database to store user data
-   join multiple chatrooms and get messages from each
-   get list of chatrooms, create own chatroom
-   get list of people in a chatroom
-   private messaging
-   access from multiple computers in a network (not just a localhost app!)
-   terminal based user interface (with colors and `altscreen`)

A picture is worth a thousand words, so a video should be worth atleast a million words:
